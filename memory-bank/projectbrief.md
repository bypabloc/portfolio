## üéØ Project Definition

### Core Problem Statement
Need for a high-performance, scalable portfolio system that demonstrates:
- Modern serverless architecture mastery
- 2025 technology stack expertise
- Professional development practices (TDD, TypeScript strict, etc.)
- Cost-effective serverless deployment patterns

### Solution Approach
**Serverless-native architecture** with complete frontend/server separation:
- **Frontend**: Astro v5 SSG with Server Islands for optimal performance
- **Server**: AWS Lambda microservices with FastAPI for rapid development
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Git-like branching for environment management
- **Development**: Docker Compose replicating production architecture locally

### Key Success Criteria
- [ ] Sub-300ms cold start performance
- [ ] Lighthouse score >90 across all categories
- [ ] 100% TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] >80% test coverage with comprehensive TDD implementation
- [ ] Zero-tolerance quality gates (no linting/type errors)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

### Separation of Concerns
- **Complete isolation** between frontend and server systems
- **Domain-driven design** with independent microservices per business area
- **API-first approach** with contract testing between all services
- **Environment parity** through consistent Docker containerization

### Technology Decisions Rationale
- **Astro v5**: Latest SSG with Server Islands for optimal performance/flexibility balance
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless-native compute with pay-per-use economics
- **FastAPI**: Python's fastest framework with automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Serverless database with Git-like branching workflow
- **TypeScript Strict**: Zero-tolerance approach to type safety
