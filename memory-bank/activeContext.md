## üéØ Current Work Session Focus

### Today's Priorities (2025-01-19)
1. **Memory Bank Creation** - Complete all 4 core files ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
2. **File Content Validation** - Ensure consistency and completeness
3. **Integration Testing** - Test memory bank with Claude Code
4. **Documentation Review** - Verify against original docs/readme.md content

### This Week's Goals
- [ ] **Memory Bank fully operational** - Claude Code successfully uses context
- [ ] **Project structure created** - Basic directory structure in place
- [ ] **Development environment decision** - Choose between local-first vs cloud-first development
- [ ] **Technology stack validation** - Confirm all version compatibility

## üöß Current Blockers & Decisions Needed

### Technical Decisions Required
1. **Development Environment Strategy**
   - Option A: Docker-first local development (as documented)
   - Option B: Cloud-first development with LocalStack
   - **Decision needed by**: End of this week
   - **Impact**: Affects entire development workflow

2. **Database Branching Strategy**
   - Option A: Feature branches for each major component
   - Option B: Environment branches only (dev/staging/prod)
   - **Decision needed by**: Before server development starts
   - **Impact**: Development workflow and testing strategy

3. **Frontend Deployment Platform**
   - **AWS CloudFront + S3** (unified AWS stack)
   - **Decision finalized**: AWS deployment only
   - **Impact**: CI/CD pipeline and deployment automation

### No Current Blockers
- All memory bank files created successfully
- No dependency conflicts identified
- Documentation is comprehensive and actionable

## üìä Progress Metrics & Health

### Documentation Completeness
- **Memory Bank Files**: 4/4 ‚úÖ **100% Complete**
- **Technical Documentation**: 5/5 files in docs/ ‚úÖ **100% Available**
- **Project Configuration**: 0/5 ‚ùå **Pending Implementation**
- **Code Implementation**: 0% ‚ùå **Not Started**

### Quality Metrics (Target vs Current)
- **Test Coverage**: Target 80% | Current: 0% (no code yet)
- **Type Safety**: Target 100% | Current: N/A (no code yet)
- **Documentation**: Target 100% | Current: 90% ‚úÖ **Excellent**
- **Architecture Definition**: Target 100% | Current: 95% ‚úÖ **Excellent**

## üîÑ Session Notes & Learnings

### Key Insights from Memory Bank Research
- **2025 Best Practice**: Simplified memory bank preferred over complex systems
- **Token Efficiency**: Keep memory files focused and lean
- **Update Frequency**: activeContext.md should be updated every session
- **Integration Pattern**: Memory bank works best with docs/ folder for detailed info

### Technical Architecture Clarifications
- **Complete Separation**: Frontend and server are fully independent systems
- **API-First Design**: All data exchange happens via HTTP APIs
- **Serverless Optimization**: Cold start performance is critical (<300ms target)
- **TDD Mandatory**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle must be followed throughout

### Development Workflow Decisions
- **Documentation-First**: Complete architectural documentation before coding
- **Memory Bank Integration**: Use for high-level context, docs/ for detailed specs
- **Quality Gates**: Zero-tolerance for type errors and linting violations
- **Environment Parity**: Local development must match production architecture

## üéØ Success Criteria for Current Phase

### Memory Bank System (Current Phase)
- [x] All 4 memory bank files created with comprehensive content
- [x] Information successfully extracted and organized from docs/readme.md
- [x] Consistent cross-references between memory bank files
- [ ] **Testing**: Claude Code successfully uses memory bank for context
- [ ] **Integration**: Smooth workflow with CLAUDE.md and docs/ folder

### Ready for Next Phase Criteria
- [ ] Memory bank operational and tested with Claude Code
- [ ] Development environment decision finalized
- [ ] Project structure created and ready for implementation
- [ ] All architectural decisions documented and approved
- [ ] Technology stack versions confirmed and compatible
